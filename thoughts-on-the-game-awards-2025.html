However I am too lazy to change what I’ve already written, so just keep this in mind. Also, this is not about the awards or who should have won/been nominated.</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever December rolls around, I can’t help but feel a sense of excitement and joy to a degree which I find really weird once the month ends and my emotions have reset to normal levels. I attribute this to the end of the semester, and the most wonderful event that graces humanity once a year: the Game Awards.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All jokes aside, I do enjoy TGA and have been tuning in to the livestreams ever since 2021 when Hazelight’s “It Takes Two” won GOTY. For four years I’ve been filling up my friend group’s Discord server with live updates on the upcoming releases and the winners from each category, trading thoughts with whoever was awake on what we would be hoping to see win or what we thought we would enjoy from the releases and announcements.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Needless to say, TGA is something I look forward to every year and I still see it as a celebration of video games even with all its flaws, which it seems to be trying to resolve somehow.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a preface, I’m not really one to complain about the ads and the release trailers too much: it’s a for-profit show so it needs advertisements to break even, and my only major grievances with the announcements is that while many of them are a spectacle to watch, they don’t show any gameplay. I would also like to say that while I do think Geoff Keighley is a bit of a shill (I am being polite about it) and that much of the scathing critiques about how he runs the show are ultimately correct, he still has it in him to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">care</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about video games.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I think that this year’s TGA (which also serves as its tenth year anniversary) was perhaps the best TGA show of all time, in part because Keighley </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cared </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and listened to the criticisms that were rightfully thrown his way. While TGA is still far from perfect, I hope that this year has set the path for a better show that truly celebrates the people behind the games we love.</span></p><p><br><br></p><h1><strong>What Went Wrong with 2023’s Game Awards</strong></h1><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year was a phenomenal year for gaming releases. Heavy emphasis on that last word, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">releases</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To claim that the year was an overall success for the industry would ignore the fact that an estimated </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1458214/worldwide-gaming-industry-layoffs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">11,250 employees were laid off in 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a sharp rise from the previous year’s 8,500. Thus, the silence from Keighley on these issues had many people (myself included) confused and even upset.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It didn’t help that the show itself seemed to be shafting the people who made the games in favor of big-time celebrity names; while Matthew McConaughey was given time to ramble on about a future project he was involved in and Timothy Chalamet (whose connection to the industry is at best, an old YouTube channel for modded Xbox controllers) got to present GOTY, Neil Newbon’s acceptance speech for Best Performance was infamously cut short and Swen Vincke was told to </span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/geoff-keighley-shows-cowardice-at-the-game-awards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wrap It Up”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during his speech for Baldur’s Gate 3’s victory which he dedicated to a colleague that passed away.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will not mince my words here. It was disrespectful that any of that occurred, and while I am glad that things changed for the better with TGA, none of that should have happened in the first place. But here we are, and I will commend the fact that Keighley seems to have taken all the critique to heart. I hope I am not proven wrong about this.</span></p><p><br><br></p><h1><strong>What Was Better in 2024’s Game Awards</strong></h1><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Admittedly, while I was looking forward to the releases, I had dour expectations for the show itself. And then, Statler and Waldorf showed up. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kidding aside, I was not expecting to enjoy the heckling segments as much as I did. In a way, it was a little cathartic to hear those two muppets making fun of Keighley and calling him a sell-out and poking fun at his bromance with Hideo Kojima. I’m sure Keighley may have had </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">some</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> knowledge of what they were going to say, but I thought the jokes were well-written in classic Statler and Waldorf fashion. However, I wouldn’t be writing so positively about TGA 2025 if all that changed was that they included self-deprecation.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the many changes was the addition of a Game Changers award to celebrate those who positively impacted the industry. Keighley began this segment with a short acknowledgement that TGA hasn’t really addressed the layoff issue, before they played a video that described the work of Amir Satvat in compiling resources for laid off developers and helping around three thousand of them back on their feet.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this a sufficient acknowledgement of the issues faced by game developers and those involved in the industry? I don’t think so. Will Satvat’s work single handedly solve the ever increasing number of layoffs? No. But nevertheless, I believe that honoring the work of those attempting to improve the state of the industry is important in encouraging others to do the same. This does not mean that strong systemic change does not need to happen, but rather </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">both</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should be pursued.</span></p><p><strong>A Sidenote on Satvat</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-game-awards-game-changer-winner-responds-hateful-comments/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was recently brought to public attention that Satvat works for Tencent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and thus his motives have come under scrutiny. I believe that it was dishonest of TGA to portray him as being “some guy” who wanted to do an altruistic act, but I genuinely believe that </span><strong>Satvat had good intentions</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with his work. As per his own statement, he was not involved in any mergers/acquisitions and was not even a Tencent employee at the time when he began his project. I can’t think of any way that this venture would have been profitable for him, so I am led to believe that he simply wanted to help others rather than him being some conniving industry plant.</span></p><p> </p><h1><strong>What Was Better in 2024’s Game Awards (cont’d)</strong></h1><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing that I noticed was that they handled the appearance of Celebrity Presenters better than last year. This is less in regards to their number (after all, in cases like presenting Best Adaptation or discussing your upcoming release with a big-name actor as the lead you kind of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to use the celebrity) and more to do with how they were used; Twitch streamer Snoop Dogg was not there to simply take up space, but aside from promoting the studio he co-founded with his son he performed a new song of his and the classic “Gin and Juice”; and how could they do an Indiana Jones segment without Harrison Ford himself? Compare that with having Anthony Mackie present “Best Ongoing” or the previously mentioned Timothy Chalamet presenting GOTY? Celebrity guests are fine if they’re naturally integrated into the show rather than shoving them in and expecting us to fawn over them and open up our wallets.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Celebs aside, we saw a wonderful slew of presenters (except for Randy Pitchford) with familiar faces ranging from creatives in the industry such as Abubakar Salim and Rebbeca Ford, to winners from previous years like Sam Lake, Josef Farez, and Swen Vincke; and of course, it wouldn’t be TGA without Hideo Kojima, and even this year’s appearance was a step up from last year in my opinion. Even the Spokesperson of Super Earth (played by Craig Lee Thomas) showed up to announce a new Helldivers update. It was nice to see these announcements from the people who’ve won our hearts with their work, and it was even better to hear them speak so passionately about the industry they work within.</span></p><p> </p><h1><strong>Wrapping It Up</strong></h1><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ten year anniversary show for The Game Awards was something unique. Alongside the usual announcements and previews, there were acknowledgements of the industry’s issues from the presenters and even from TGA itself as they introduced a new category that will hopefully inspire many more within the industry to help one another. While this is no remedy for collective action and unionization, to provide a platform with which to discuss these issues in front of millions of people is in my eyes, a net positive.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To close off, I would like to highlight </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvRm4HKK4gQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the words of Swen Vincke</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who was finally given the chance to talk. When Vincke gave his speech as presenter for GOTY 2024, he seemed to be speaking for both the developers and the fans of video games. He rightfully called out the layoffs and the constant cash-grabbing that corpo suits force onto their games in hopes of affording another car for their vintage collection. He spoke the evergreen truth that when developers aren’t overworked and underpaid, given time to perfect their projects, and don’t have to worry about losing their job within the year, what emerges is something beautiful.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The corrosive spirit of profit-chasing is rampant in so many aspects of life, and while Vincke is but another person pointing it out, to be able to call it out in a room where those who embody this spirit the most will </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">definitely hear it</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is certainly worth noting. Maybe if we’re lucky, the next Muppets segment will be Keighley yelling out passages of Das Kapital in an argument with Sam the Eagle.</span></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on December 20, 2024</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://funbunggo.github.io/funbunggo/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://funbunggo.github.io/funbunggo/authors/funbunggo/" rel="author">Funbunggo</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://funbunggo.github.io/funbunggo/the-scholar-and-the-all-knowing.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> The Scholar and the All-Knowing</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p><p>Rockin' since 2024</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://funbunggo.github.io/funbunggo/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://funbunggo.github.io/funbunggo/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
