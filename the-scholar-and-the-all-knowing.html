All around him, Ziton the Scholar saw naught but the pale ash that drowned the city of Leyndell. Above him, amidst the cinders that danced in the air like the smoldering butterflies of Mt. Gelmir, was that wispy golden trail that guided him everywhere, this time pointing to an unsullied staircase. With little else left to do, he climbed it and rode the lift upwards. Another damned set of stairs awaited him, though he had slowed his pace this time.</span></p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is it, isn’t it?</span></i></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he rose from his grave, he had never envisioned that Lordship was to become his fate. He stared at his gloves of metal scales and black leather, a reminder of his past life; a hunter of tarnished who had lost the blessing of grace, and whence it returned the killer sought to play a scholar, then a Lord. And yet he had only come so far by spilling the blood of men and demigods alike. Perhaps he truly was nothing more than a murderer, only now he’d sharpened his mind to match the edge of his blade. Even as he climbed up the steps of Leyndell with the Erdtree burning in the far distance, the former confessor could just barely believe what he had done to the world, and what he was soon to do to it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally reaching the top of the stairs, he felt at ease upon seeing a familiar face at the center of the chamber, arms outstretched and scepter in hand. Admittedly, he had little reason to call Sir Gideon Ofnir a friend any longer, but the great blasphemy still weighed heavily upon his soul and companionship was scarce to be found in the final moments of the world. When he returned to the Roundtable Hold, the only people who remained were poor Roderika and Hewg, whose mind was beginning to slip away from him. Everyone else had died or fled elsewhere, and Ziton was ashamed to admit that he had played a part in some of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had seen to D’s death unwittingly as a pawn of the Lady Fia, and it was he who cut down both the Sorcerer Rogier and that vile Dung Eater, though the former was hardly himself in that strange realm of Death, and he was loath to refer to the latter as companion in any noble sense of the word. Truthfully, it was only Ensha whom he’d meant to kill, yet he knew the man far too little to mourn him nor curse his name once the blood had been spilled. The only ones he hadn’t killed had been Nepheli whom he’d handed the ashes of a stormhawk; Corhyn who he’d last seen laughing madly over the corpse of his once idol Goldmask; and finally, Gideon, who stood in front of him with arms wide open.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He called out to him, but the All-Knowing merely stood still and droned on about Queen Marika and an eternal struggle, and many other things that only confused Ziton. What had happened to old Gideon Ofnir? First, he’d become a monster in his pursuit to fix the world, trampling on those poor Albinaurics and abandoning his daughter; now, he was a shell of a man and a pitiable thing that lacked what remaining dignity and aspirations that even the monstrous Gideon held.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziton knew that he would not be granted passage without a fight, and as Gideon lifted up his scepter Ziton had taken the staff from his belt and in his other hand he held a seal of the Golden Order; though he carried with him a fine dagger of erdsteel and a pilfered crossbow from the Land of Shadow, the former remained in its sheath and the latter upon his back. Soured memories be damned, he was determined to do justice by his old mentor and grant him death at the hands of a fellow seeker of knowledge. The smell of ozone filled the air as the All-Knowing sent forth a great blue beam of a comet that the Scholar had only narrowly avoided. He returned fire with a cluster of twelve dark stars which chased Gideon, and as he focused his efforts on dodging the stars he failed to notice Ziton running towards him, his own staff raised high in the air. Cerulean energies surrounded its tip, swirling and binding together to form a mighty gavel which he slammed unto Gideon, knocking him prone and cracking some of his armor.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To his surprise, Gideon had gotten up quickly and fell into a chant, catching the careless Scholar in an eruption of black flame that enveloped his body and forced Ziton to throw aside the hat he’d taken from Rogier after his passing. The pain of the black fire was great but only for a moment, before all sensation had disappeared and only numbness remained. When the flames died down and his vision had returned to him, Ziton saw above him the All-Knowing surrounded by the spectral petals of a scarlet lotus that was all too familiar. He raised high in the air his mighty seal and called upon the power of the ancient dragons; a hail of red lightning fell from the sky, and though Gideon writhed in pain with each bolt that struck him, he did not relent and the deathly bud did not dissipate.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the All-Knowing began his swift descent, Ziton made a vain attempt to flee to a far corner of the chamber. Gideon landed, dazed and prone on the floor as the flower bloomed, its spectral petals unfurling in a vibrant explosion and scattering a vile red pollen in the air that stung his nose. The sight of his old mentor struggling to get on his feet sent Ziton into a charge, black staff in both hands as he channeled glintstone through it once more. He could feel small strips of flesh sloughing off of his person with each step, but he neither faltered nor stumbled in his advance. This time, he wielded the icy projection of a longsword which he swung with ferocity at the staggered Gideon; not once did the blade itself strike gideon, but the wave of ice it sent forth had cracked the centerpiece of his armor and exposed the padding beneath it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziton continued to swing ‘til the sword began to fade and all his magic had been spent, and he took Gideon’s sheathing of his own staff to mean that he too had exhausted himself. Neither man looked like the erudite gentlemen that they had been during their first meeting or even before their battle began. The All-Knowing’s armor had been shattered in several places, the exposed flesh once pallid now black with frostbite or bruises; though the Scholar’s armor seemed to be much more intact, he was far more unsightly with near visible bones as the rot slowly stripped from him his flesh, and what little of it that remained was touched and scarred by the black flame.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gideon, now back on his feet, began to approach Ziton.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Give up! Ambition has been your folly, our folly! We—”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever his next words were to be, they merely died on his lips as Ziton unloaded a volley of bolts into his former mentor, each landing and tearing through flesh and battered armor with ease. The final bolt lodged itself in Gideon’s throat, and the last words of the All-Knowing would fall from his mouth as a wet and unintelligible gurgle before he collapsed upon the floor. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ziton too, fell, resting on his knees as he took in the sight of his greatest teacher, dead by his own hands and with a lunatic’s despair writ across his wide open eyes. To think that this man was once a noble sage, that one could fall victim to their own hunger for justice only to reach the end of their life a blubbering fool with neither heart nor spirit. Ziton laughed, for he was no better; a bloodthirsty fanatic who sought redemption through wisdom and study, and yet for all the knowledge he’d gathered from the ancient tomes and scrolls, he could never purge the assassin’s instinct from his soul. This time, it had possessed him, and once again he had fallen back on his old ways as a killer and a craven. Could a man so faulty in his convictions truly bring order to the Lands Between?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scholar looked up, and surely enough that damned trail of light was there once more to lead him onwards. Craven, killer, seeker, scholar; Ziton had been bestowed many titles throughout his life, all earned through acts both vicious and valorous. He had known grace, lost it, and once more it returned to him and set him upon the path of knowledge. Grace had been his guiding light, and perhaps his true mentor. And now it called upon him once more to lay claim to another title; that of the Elden Lord.</span></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on November 3, 2024</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://funbunggo.github.io/funbunggo/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://funbunggo.github.io/funbunggo/authors/funbunggo/" rel="author">Funbunggo</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://funbunggo.github.io/funbunggo/retirement-2.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Retirement</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://funbunggo.github.io/funbunggo/thoughts-on-the-game-awards-2025.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Thoughts On The Game Awards 2025</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p><p>Rockin' since 2024</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://funbunggo.github.io/funbunggo/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://funbunggo.github.io/funbunggo/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
